<h2>Additional Rules</h2>
<h3>Starter Stage Striking</h3>
<p>Players play a best-of-1 Rock-Paper-Scissors, and winner may choose to either strike a stage first or select a port first. Stages are stuck in a P1-P2-P2-P1 order.
  Players may strike from the legal stages (each person strikes stages in a 1-2-1 format) to determine the starting stage for the first game. If battlefield or final destination is chosen and both parties agree, a variant can be used.</p>

<h3>Counterpick Stage Striking</h3>
<p>After each game of the set, before counterpicking, the player who won the previous game may strike two stages from the starter list. This strike does not persist throughout the set. If final destination or battlefield is chosen as a counterpick, a variant may be chosen by the loser of the previous game.</p>

<h3>Controllers</h3>
<p>For ease of access, Tournament Staff recommends the use of the Nintendo Gamecube controller, however, The Switch Pro controller (wired) and Joy cons are all permitted control options. Turbo/Macro options on controllers are banned. Box variants of the gcc are currently permitted so long as they do not have macros/turbo enabled.</p>

<h3>Controller Interference</h3>
<p>If your controller is found to be the cause of disruption to the tournament (mid-game or otherwise), you are subject to complete disqualification from the event. </p>

<h3>Mii Fighter Clause</h3>
<p>Mii Fighters must be created using Guest Miis and their name should contain the moves being used in the format ‘xxxx’. Any combination of moves may be used, but once a player has selected a Special Move Set for a specific Mii Fighter type (Brawler/Swordfighter/Gunner) that Set must be paired with that Fighter type for the remainder of the set.</p>
